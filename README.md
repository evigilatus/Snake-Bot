This project aims conduct experiments with different approaches toward solving the popular 2D
”Snake” game in the following modes:
   
    1. Standard
    2. With a wall placed on the playground
    3. With a maze
The algorithms implemented as part of this project are:
   
    1. Deep Q-Learning with Prioritized Experience Replay
    2. Double Deep Q-Networks
    3. Dueling Deep Q-Networks
